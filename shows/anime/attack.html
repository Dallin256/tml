Plot
</p>
<p>
Eren Yeager lives with his foster sister Mikasa Ackerman and best friend Armin Arlert in the town of Shiganshina adjacent to Wall Maria, outermost of three circular walls protecting humanity from man-eating Titans that are said to have killed all other humans one hundred years prior. When Shiganshina and Wall Maria are breached by the Colossal and Armored Titans, invading Titans force humanity to retreat behind Wall Rose with Eren's mother among the casualties. Following the disappearance of his father Grisha, having only hazy memories and a key to their home's cellar, a vengeful Eren enlists in the military along with Mikasa and Armin, swearing to eradicate every last Titan.
