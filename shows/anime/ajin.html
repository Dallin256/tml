Plot
</p>
<p>
Ajin: Demi-human presents the story of a student named Kei Nagai (永井 圭 Nagai Kei), who discovers he is an "Ajin" when he is fatally wounded in a traffic accident. In the world of Ajin, a small number of humans (termed "Ajin") possess extreme regenerative abilities that trigger upon death or mortal injury, allowing them to completely recover from their wounds in a matter of seconds to such an exceptional extent that not only can missing limbs be restored, but Ajin can fully regenerate after being turned into literal meat patties. Additionally, Ajin can create "black ghosts", which are highly dangerous combat-oriented entities that are invisible to normal humans and only visible to other Ajin. "Black ghosts" are resistant to physical injury and exhibit extraordinary physical strength, and have razor-sharp teeth and claws. Different "black ghosts" have varying degrees of intelligence. For example, most "black ghosts" are completely reliant on their Ajin for directions, and others, such as that of Kei's, are more independent and likely to engage in self-initiated actions.

Consequently, Ajin are considered dangerous and inhuman by the public, and most are captured by governments. On paper, governments claim to protect Ajin, but in reality, most governments use them as subjects for cruel and inhumane experiments, as their abilities to completely recover from fatal wounds provides an unlimited source of organs and bodies in dangerous tests (such as live-fire weapons testing). As a result, Ajin that have escaped from government custody (such as Satou, the main antagonist) are bent on exacting revenge from governments – with the exception of Kei, who wants no part in the emerging Ajin-human conflict. However, in an agreement with Japanese governmental agents, Kei agrees to fight against Satou in exchange for his freedom from government experimentation.
