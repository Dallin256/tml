Plot
</p>
<p>
In Victorian-era London lives a thirteen-year-old earl named Ciel Phantomhive,
 who acquired this position after the events of December 14th, 1885 (Ciel's 10th birthday), 
when the Phantomhive manor was attacked by unidentified perpetrators and was set ablaze. Ciel,
 amidst the chaos, discovers his parents, Vincent and Rachel Phantomhive, to be dead along with
 the family dog, Sebastian. The same night he is kidnapped by the attackers and then sold into
 slavery, where he ends up in the hands of a sadistic, demon-worshipping cult. Ciel then
 endures endless physical, mental and sexual abuse at the hands of his captors. Ciel was
 also heat branded with a mark referred to as the "mark of the beast". One night, during
 a sacrificial ceremony to summon a demon, instead of forming a contract with the cult
 members, the demon states that he was summoned by Ciel, therefore he only agrees to
 form a contract with him, killing all the cultist members in the process.<br><br> To show a
 contract was formed, the demon places a contract symbol referred to as the Faustian
 contract symbol on Ciel's right eye, giving it a purple hue, and his iris and pupil
 now showcase the symbol of the covenant. After the formation of the contract, the demon
 reveals he will consume Ciel's soul as payment for helping him achieve his goal; revenge
 on those who brought down the House of Phantomhive. Afterwards Ciel names the demon Sebastian Michaelis,
 after his deceased pet dog. The duo then return to society as Ciel takes over his now late
 father's previous position as the queen's watchdog, a very high-profile individual who is tasked with
 investigating cases that Queen Victoria herself deems especially important or threatening to England and the crown.
